    <h1 id="welcome">Hello! Welcome to Trailblazer.</h1>
    <br> This app is meant to manage everything in life.
    <br> Sounds ambitious, but hear me out.
    <br> The basic workflow of the app is as follows:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Add/remove <b><a href = "#trails">TRAILS and SUBTRAILS</a> </b> </li>
        <li>
            Check off items as you go through the day</li>
        <li>
            <b><a href = "#blazePanel"> EVALUATE</a></b> the day after it ends
        </li>
        <li>
            On the side, track <b><a href = "#tasks">TASKS</a> and use the <a href = "#notebook">NOTEBOOK</a></b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br> Let’s get started!

        <li>
            <b>Trailboxes</b> subTrail names popup on hover, toggle for completion
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br> NOTE: subTrail cards work the same way as Trails
    <br> BUT a trail two levels deep cannot have subtrails under it.
    <br>IE: Math -> HW -> Fourier Series – Fourier Series can’t have subtrails.

    This panel contains what I personally do with the app - ultimately, you decide how Trailblazer helps you.<br>
    <h2>GENERAL WORKFLOW</h2>
    <h3>HABITS</h3>
    I tend to do Habits first - they get me started during the day (or the afternoon when I'm tired). For this reason, my Habits are generally quick, routine, rote, and less than 5 minutes. It should be something you can feasibly keep up with without too much pressure. Examples: Clean Room, Quick Excercise, Meditate, etc.
    <h3>WORK + HOBBIES</h3>
    After you're a bit more focused, you'll be able to work on more complex things. Trailblazer treats Work and Hobbies as projects - they have subTrails for ease of planning. Obviously, prioritize work with deadlines first - I recommend NOT involving tasks or specific dates for this. If there's an important deadline, chances are you're well aware of it already. But then again, that's up to you.<br>
    I use the subTrail mode for a Work/Hobby, which allows me to focus, as well as quickly add subTrails as needed. Utilize subTrails - they're meant to visualize the entire Trail you're working on, for the sake of better awareness and time allocation.
    <h3>TASKS</h3>
    Throughout this process, in a parallel fashion, you want to work on your Tasks a little. Tasks should strictly be quick one time events - handing off something, payments, etc.<br> I use the toggle button to remind myself whether this Task can be worked on today - I regularly check back to make sure I don't miss things.
